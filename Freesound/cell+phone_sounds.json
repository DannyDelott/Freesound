When I originally got the Treo it was stored on there as a tiny MIDI file, but it was too short.  So I downloaded it to Cubase, lengthened the note and stored it in the 'phone again.  The 'chirp' proved really popular although until now I had no way to give it to others because their 'phones had different MIDI ringtone specifications.  Now, though, I got a new 'phone, so it was time to record it as audio.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing about this sound is that at the studio we developed the habit of looking around at the roof whenever a text message came in, leading many people to believe that there was actually a bird in the control room somewhere.  :-)\r\n\r\nRecorded at Pulsworks Audio Arts by Lloyd Jackson.  Josephson C42 mic, NPNG preamp.

The CD stand is approximately 5'6\" / 167cm tall and made of angled sheet metal with horizontal slots all the way up for holding the discs.  As such it has an amazing resonance which we have frequently employed as an impromptu reverb.  The source was captured with a contact mic (made from an old Audio Technica wireless headset) through the NPNG preamp and into Pro Tools via Frontier Design Group converters.  Final edits were performed in Cool Edit Pro.  The objects used included hands, a mobile 'phone vibrating alert, a ping-pong ball, a pocket knife, plastic cups and others.
